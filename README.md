## RP2350 issue with internal pull-down resistors:

> The RP2350 microcontroller has a documented bug affecting its internal pull-down resistors. When a GPIO pin is configured as an input with an internal
> pull-down resistor enabled, the pin can exhibit latching behavior. Specifically, after the pin is driven high (e.g., by pressing a button that connects the
> pin to 3.3V) and then released, it may remain at an intermediate voltage (around 2.1â€“2.2V) instead of returning to a low state. This can cause the input to
> read as high even when the button is not pressed.
>
> Due to this issue, it's safer to configure digital inputs with pull-up resistors.
